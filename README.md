# MenuAPI
MenuAPI is an API that excells at conciseness, ease of use, and flexibility. As a developer, I got sick and tired of having to create separate listeners in separate classes for doing the simplest of things. Inventory menus took a long time because of the sheer amount of calculations and code that were needed. Now you can make a sleek, professional inventory menu in minutes using this powerful core. Wow the server owners who use your plugin with this API.

# Maven Dependencies
MenuAPI uses Maven to make things easier for you. If you're making a Maven project, you can add the repository like this:

```
	<repositories>
	        <repository>
	            <id>MenuAPI-repo</id>
	            <url>https://github.com/ColonelHedgehog/MenuAPI/raw/master/</url>
	        </repository>
	</repositories>
```
Then, to depend on the project, just add this:
```
	<dependencies>
	        <dependency>
	            <groupId>com.ColonelHedgehog</groupId>
	            <artifactId>MenuAPI</artifactId>
	            <version>1.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
	        </dependency>
	</dependencies>
```

<b>Please note:</b> This cannot be used as a substitute to <code>depend: [MenuAPI]</code> in your plugin.yml. This is project-based <u>only</u>.
